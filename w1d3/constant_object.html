    Is it possible to change an object declared with const ? What do you think?

    <code>
    const user = { <br/>
        name: "John"<br/>
        };<br/>
        // does it work?<br/>
        user.name = "Pete";<br/>
        </code>

Yes, it is possible. you can change an object declared with const but you can't re-assign it.
